# Intro Financial Mathematics Academic Project
This project was my first introduction to financial mathematics. More specifically, the aim here is to determine the price and hedge of European options, by studying 2 widely used models, the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model (binomial model) and the Black-Scholes model.
